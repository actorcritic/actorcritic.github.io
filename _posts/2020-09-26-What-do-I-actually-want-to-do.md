title:  What do I actually want to do?
---
When being a sophomore, I thought that I would want to become a programmer at top companies. Therefore, I need to learn algorithms for competition programming or interview programming. However, despite spending a lot of time on it and some improvements, my results weren't good. The reason was that I wasn't consistent enough over the course of a year studying algorithm. I had not practiced for some periods of 2 to 3 weeks, and after coming back I slowed down and this was frustrating.
